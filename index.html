         At BEFWF, we prioritise a people-centrist and participatory
approach,viewing the communities we serve as partners   in their

         This ensures their active involvement in identifying and addressing
their needs. We focus on long-term sustainable interventions that foster

overall community development. We strive to balance economic, social,
environmental, and institutional dimensions of sustainability, placing a
strong emphasis on collaborations and partnerships to facilitate mutual
learning and leverage each other's strengths effectively.
